Problem Statement:

    In order to aggregate interesting data and also to keep up with the “trends” we will aggregate data from Twitter.
    We will collect Twitter data for different ranges of dates (week-range, month-range). Aggregated raw data needs 
    to be cleansed to some extend before analyzing it using Big-data methods.
    (i) We want to find out the most trending words.
    (ii) We are also interested in finding out co-occurring hash tags, 
    (iii) We want to cluster the tweeters by the number of followers they have. We will need three clusters where 
        the average number of followers is low, medium and high respectively, where the actual average value for
        each cluster will depend on your data size. This information may be used for marketing and for targeting 
        the ads/messages.
    Visualize the results thus obtained.
